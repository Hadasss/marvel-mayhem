## User Story

As a movie enthusiast

I want to know if a certain book title was made into a movie

So that I can watch the big screen version of my favirite books.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a dashboard with input field to search for book and movie titles

\*1/30/22: added basic HTML Layout with input field to supply search criteria for API's

When I search for a title

Then I am presented with existing books and movies of the same title in 2 different APIs

When I click on deatails

Then I am presented with movie ratings and other books/movies in the series

When I search for a title

Then the data is persistent and I am able to browse again through previous searches
